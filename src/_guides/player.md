## Details ##

Upon loading the widget, students must first complete a questionnaire by moving sliders pertaining to each question. Each slider should have contextual labels representing the range of response, such as "Like" and "Dislike", or "Agree" and "Disagree". Move the slider based on your response to each question. Once all question sliders have been interacted with, click "Submit" at the bottom to view the generated radar graph.
